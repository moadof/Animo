After Dariel intervenes to help Marika, she invites him to stay at her village in return.

Despite having to inherit a title of great responsibility, she agreed to the proposal, enticed by the prospect of gaining access to the royal archives housing a wide selection of books.\r\n\r\nTo this day, Elianna firmly believes that her engagement is void of romantic sentiment. When she notices Christopher's interactions with another girl, she presumes that the days she spends with him will soon reach an end. Yet, during this period of uncertainty, Elianna and Christopher open a new chapter in their relationship, gradually uncovering their genuine feelings as they grow to better understand each other."

Residing in her jet-black palace and isolated from the emperor, she is the subject of countless rumors. Claimed to possess mystic abilities, she is said to take on any request\u2014from finding lost items to inflicting curses. While some call her an immortal sage, others believe her to be a terrifying revenant. But such comments fail to faze Jusetsu, who prefers to spend her days in quiet solitude. That is, until the emperor, Ka Koushun, barges into her court and asks for her assistance with a mysterious case.\r\n\r\nThe young emperor's request requires Jusetsu to step out of her palace for the first time. Despite Ka Koushun's frequent visits annoying her to no end, she cannot bring herself to turn him away. Her predecessor's teachings echo in her ears: the Raven Consort is destined to remain forever alone and never desire anything. Yet Jusetsu finds herself making the first of several bonds when she asks Jiujiu, an innocently inquisitive court girl, to be her sole attendant.\r\n\r\nTogether, they begin fulfilling requests from the people of the palace. However, unknown perils lurk in the outside world, and drawing attention to herself may bring Jusetsu face-to-face with a past that is better left undisturbed."

Unfortunately, he was just fired from his last job and as a high school student, he doesn't have many other prospects.\r\n\r\nOne evening, he's attacked by a centipede monster on his way home. Shinichirou is saved by a mysterious girl with a bow and arrow, who he later discovers is Sakuya Shimazu, a beautiful student who attends his school. But when he later helps an injured girl, he discovers two things. First, the injured girl isn't human at all but rather a nekomata, a two-tailed demon cat. And second, Sakuya comes from a family of exorcists, who've protected humanity from rogue monsters and spirits for generations. Because Shinichirou was responsible for releasing the nekomata, Sakuya enlists his help in recapturing the demon, but that's just the beginning of Shinichirou's relationship with Sakuya. It turns out the Shimazu family needs a housekeeper and it just so happens that Shinichirou excels at cooking and likes to clean! It may not be his dream job, but if it pays the rent and puts food on the table..."

        "description": "In their teenage years, few things can hurt people more than the heartaches that come with unrequited love. Such is the case for Natsuo Fujii, who has found himself entranced by his school's ever-cheerful teacher Hina. Deflated by this unreachable desire, Natsuo humors his friends and attends a mixer. There he meets Rui, a girl whose lack of excitement rivals that of himself. After bonding over their mutual awkwardness, Rui takes Natsuo to her house and asks him to have sex with her, hoping that the experience will stop her friends from treating her like a clueless child. With his hopeless feelings towards Hina still on his mind, Natsuo hesitantly agrees.\r\n\r\nEqually unfulfilled by their \"first times,\" the two decide to part ways as strangers. However, before he even has a chance to process this experience, Natsuo's father drops a major bombshell: he is getting remarried, and his new wife Tsukiko Tachibana is coming over now to meet Natsuo. As if that was not enough of a shock, her daughters\u2014and, in turn, Natsuo's new sisters\u2014are Hina and Rui Tachibana, the woman he's in love with and the girl with whom he shared his first night. Now, Natsuo must come to terms with the feelings he has for his step-siblings as his eyes open to a darker side of love.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money.  One wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past.  Now in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?"

Dedicated Huntsmen and Huntresses battle Grimm with both customized weapons and their own \"Semblances,\" unique abilities derived from the energy of one's soul. Some warriors also utilize a crystallized energy propellant, \"Dust,\" to bestow their weapons with elemental properties. In this dangerous line of work, rigorous training is required to stay alive. To that end, each of Remnant's four Kingdoms have established schools to properly groom children holding aspirations of becoming licensed Huntsmen.  At Beacon Academy in the Kingdom of Vale, a promising group of future Huntresses make their debut as Team RWBY. Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long each come from different backgrounds and often butt heads as a result. However, when they cooperate, they are a formidable force who have even attracted the attention of Beacon's headmaster Professor Ozpin. Alongside fellow students such as those in Team JNPR, the young prodigy Ruby and her friends engage in adventures which pit them against an extremist Faunus group known as the White Fang. Every explosive encounter also brings them closer to the true villains orchestrating conflicts from the shadows."

        "description": "The Pioneer Expedition was a mission to confront alien forces in space to prevent interplanetary war on Earth. It took place concurrently with the 2nd and 3rd Robotech wars. The expedition was led by Lisa Hayes aboard the SDF-3, which was launched in 2022 in search of the Robotech Masters. The mission soon became preoccupied with the liberation of worlds under the control of the Invid Regent. In June 2030, the final battle of the Second Robotech War caused a release of the spores of the Invid flower of life across Earth, which soon attracted the Invid. In 2031, the Invid, under the control of the Regis, invaded Earth. The United Earth Forces (including the elite Army of the Southern Cross) had been severely weakened by the Second Robotech War and were only able to offer limited resistance. In less than a week, the Invid seized control of the planet and began utilizing the human population for slave labour and scientific experiments. In 2038 and 2042, the REF sent the 10th and 21st Mars divisions to try to retake the planet, but both ended in complete failure. It was only with the third attempt in 2044, which involved all available REF forces (now equipped with new technology known as new Reflex Weapons and Shadow Techno Fighters obtained from the Haydonites) that the Invid were dislodged from Earth."

Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock.\r\n\r\nThe project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers."

The entire series consists of around 1 minute-long gags that show us fractions of the daily lives of our main characters. These follow the overall story line in a manner that makes the overall structure seem closer to continuity than episodic.\r\n\r\nThe events vary greatly from our characters building snowmen in winter scenery to office parties and character specific problems that can only be solved with the help of friends. Most of the events are rather cute and heartwarming while the atmosphere is consistently comforting. That's pretty much the only noteworthy side of the story, and those who don't find this to sound interesting at all, most likely won't find any beauty from it."

The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (\u7d19\u829d\u5c45, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, \"Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side...\" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby."

Totosai and Jaken arrive at the scene, and Totosai states that he needs three whole days to mend Tenseiga. Unfortunately, by that time, Setsuna's vital essence will have been already sent to the Underworld, thus rendering the repaired Tenseiga powerless and that they have no other option but to rely on Towa's own demonic strength and will. While Towa struggles to utilize Tenseiga's heavenly abilities to try and save her twin's spiritual essence, Totosai retrieves the hilt of Setsuna's broken naginata and begins to restore it to create the blood bade she inherited from being one of Sesshomaru's half-demon daughters, the Yukari no Takichri. This greater infusion of a blend of pure demonic and mystical energy attracts a mass of demons both living and deceased. Moroha utilizes her somewhat stronger and more effective spiritual powers to purify a few dozen demons all at once with one single arrow alone, with backup from Kiara, but the two are largely outnumbered by their fellows. As the horde of demons' turn their attention to a concerned Sesshomaru and his unconscious twin daughters, the recently resurrected Setsuna awakes upon her name being said by her father, who fiercely holds her greatly advanced and upgraded naginata aloft, the Yukari no Tachikiri, and easily slays the demons, which Moroha and Kiara had not been able to do away with, in one single stroke. Sesshomaru then hands the broken Tenseiga to Totosai for its three day mending, and leaves with Jaken. Before leaving himself, Totosai warns Setsuna to never let herself be murdered again as the Tenseiga can only return sentient beings, human or demon, to life only once. While Towa remains unconscious from having drained herself of all her demonic energy to resurrect her twin sister, Totosai instructs Setsuna on how look for a mystical Kyuyokon root from the 214 year old Magnolia demon tree Bokusenoh to receive a proper demonic weapon for Towa, in place of the Kikujomonchi that she has been foolishly wielding since her return to the timeline of her birth."

Super simple setup. 5 minute long episodes that center around the daily life of mythical creatures, deities and demi-gods who live in modern society in the human form, or a form that mildly reminds humans. The entire series consists of around 1 minute-long gags that show us fractions of the daily lives of our main characters. These follow the overall story line in a manner that makes the overall structure seem closer to continuity than episodic.\r\n\r\nThe events vary greatly from our characters building snowmen in winter scenery to office parties and character specific problems that can only be solved with the help of friends. Most of the events are rather cute and heartwarming while the atmosphere is consistently comforting. That's pretty much the only noteworthy side of the story, and those who don't find this to sound interesting at all, most likely won't find any beauty from it."

While on the surface the public believes the war is being fought between machines, in reality, the Juggernauts are being piloted by humans, all of whom are \"86\"\u2014the designation given to the Colorata minority of San Magnolia. The 86 originally had equal rights, but were persecuted and scapegoated by the dominant Alba race and the Alba-supremacist Republic government to the point where Colorata were both officially designated and popularly considered subhuman. The 86 were not permitted to have personal names and were immured in internment camps in the 86th District (their namesake); all the while being forced to fight in the Republic's war with the Empire to receive better treatment.\r\n\r\nMajor Vladilena \"Lena\" Miliz\u00e9, an Alba noble and military officer in the San Magnolian military, is an outspoken activist against the grave mistreatment of the nation's Colorata minority, and the willful deception of the Republic government to the general public. She is assigned as the Handler of the Spearhead Squadron of the Eastern Front: an elite unit composed entirely of 86 veterans who have earned names. Led by their squad leader, Shinei \"The Undertaker\" Nouzen, the Spearhead Squadron is infamous among military officials. Its notoriety stems from the state in which its commanding officers are left: Handlers presiding over the squad have descended into insanity and some have gone as far as committing suicide. Lena, an avowed 86 sympathizer, gets to know the Spearhead Squadron in her time as head of the contingent. At same time, Lena and Shinei learn a dark secret: the Republic and the war with the Empire are not what they seem."

Twelve years have passed since the end of the second Neo Zeon War (Char's Rebellion). Even after \"the Axis Shock,\" which seemed to indicate the future of humanity and the Universal Century, the world is still in a chaotic situation where intermittent military conflicts continue to break out. The Earth Federation government is more corrupt than ever, and its leadership has not only accelerated Earth's pollution, but also implemented an inhuman \"Man Hunting\" policy in which civilians are forcibly exiled to outer space.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Federation government organization \"Mafty,\" led by someone called \"Mafty Navue Erin,\" has taken a stand against the corruption of the Earth Sphere. Mafty carries out fierce acts of terrorism, assassinating high officials of the Federation government one after another, but it gains a certain level of support from the populace who are growing more opposed to the Federation government.\r\n\r\nThe person who calls himself \"Mafty\" and leads this organization is Hathaway Noa, the son of Bright Noa, an officer of the Earth Federation Forces who once participated in the One Year War. Hathaway himself joined the forces trying to stop Char\u2019s Rebellion. With firsthand knowledge of the ideals and ideologies of Amuro Ray and Char Aznable, he has become a warrior following in their footsteps, and plans to clear a path forward through armed resistance. His destiny, however, is drastically altered as he encounters the Federation Forces officer Kenneth Sleg and a mysterious young beauty named Gigi Andalucia.\r\n\r\n(Source: Gundam.info)"

Since this large-scale amalgamation, the humans from the virtual world call themselves \"Green Earth\" and the original Earth humans call themselves \"Blue Earth,\" and they've come to cause various conflicts with each other repeatedly below the surface. Eventually, Dewey Novak, a senior officer in the Green Earth Armed Forces, rises together with his comrades and finally sets a large-scale terrorism plan into action in order to protect their own dignity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Eureka, who is detested by the world as the main cause of the chaos, has become a high-grade combatant with the UN's A.C.I.D. unit. Live in order to keep this world at peace... This was the path of atonement she chose. One day, she receives an order to protect a girl named Iris, a new \"Eureka\" who has the ability to control scab coral. They fight a lot at first but gradually come to understand each other through their lonely escape. Soon the world faces a crisis, and when that happens, Eureka draws on every last ounce of her strength as she fights. \"I want to protect Iris and this world.\" What future awaits her at the end of that wish of hers?"

He goes home and convinces Doraemon to use \"time wrapping cloth\" on the fossil egg and twin dinosaurs emerged. Doraemon found that they are a new species of dinosaur not listed in the \"Complete Encyclopedia of Space\". Nobita named the twin dinosaurs Kyu and Myu, and under the advice of Dr. Dinosaur learned how to take care of them. The two fast-growing animals gradually showed a difference. While Myu has learned to fly, Kyu has not and was smaller in size than Myu. As Kyu and Myu grew bigger, Nobita's room was not enough so they used the \"Breeding diorama set\" to allow Kyu and Myu more freedom. The day where Nobita fulfills his dare came, and as his friends arrived they discovered that Nobita has indeed found a dinosaur. At this point Kyu and Myu made a lot of commotion leading to Nobita's mom to come upstairs. They tried to hide Kyu and Myu by using the \"spatial movement crayon\", however, the townspeople saw Kyu and Myu. They realized Kyu and Myu reached the limit of growth, and should return to their time. Nobita had trouble accepting this, but decided it might be the best option."

For example, he'll take out his stomach and inflate it with air to use as a pillow, or if he gets wet, he'll detach parts of his body and wring them out like towels, then reattach them with a glue stick. Everything is depicted in a cute, cartoony fashion so as not to be too graphic for kids.(Source: Baka-Updates)"

The kids and even his family call him a \"cry baby\". However, he is not a coward -- not a \"chicken\" at all. His distress comes from a desire to prevent unreasonable acts and the wrong doings in life.\r\n\r\nHis older sister is the only person who understands his depth.
